# Enrollment Time Series Model
This is an ARIMA time series model trained on enrollment data (2014 - 2023) generated by the Office of Planning and Institutional Research at Columbia University. The model is now ready to
make forecasts. 
## Project Phases
- Identification: this includes dropping irrelevant data, narrowing the dataset to contain only graduate engineering enrollment and plotting the time series data to check for trends and determine stationarity by ocular inspection. Additionally, augmented Dicky-Fuller test was used to statistically test for stationarity which led to transforming the data through differencing before plotting the autocorrelation function.

- Estimation: Using auto_arima and the dataset to train the model coefficients. This led to the determination of the ARIMA model order with the lowest aic. The model was fitted using ARIMA(1, 1, 1)

- Model diagnostic: to confirm residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed

- Production:  Using the model to make forecasts, the mean absolute error is 504.4. The fall headcount enrollment for 2024 is predicted to be between 4,158 and 5490 students.
